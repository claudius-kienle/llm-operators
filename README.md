### LLM-Operators
Learning planning domain models from natural language and grounding.

Note from the maintainer (Lio Wong): this is a pre-released version of the full model and branch for https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.08566 as a reference implementation. Parts of this model currently reference internal, user-specific code (eg. the Jacinle library). This is also best set up to run each domain in the paper (ALFRED, crafting world) separately, as unfortunately these domains have conflicting Python requirements due to background compatability with ALFRED's AI2Thor installation. Please contact the main paper author if you run into problems! I will continue updating documentation for each of the `main` entrypoints towards replication of the paper results, but am prioritizing release as I have been contacted several times!

### ALFRED experiment quickstart. This sets up the repository to run experiments with the ALFRED dataset.
The lab notebook for these experiments is located at `alfred_experiments_README.md`.
The following setup has been tested on an M1 Mac.
1. Install GIT LFS if you don't already have it ([see this help documentation.](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage))
2. *Download the ALFRED PDDL files*. 
```
git clone git@github.com:CatherineWong/llm_operators_datasets.git 
unzip llm_operators_datasets/alfred_linearized_pddl.zip
mv -R alfred_linearized_pddl data/dataset/alfred_linearized_pddl
```
- Developer notes: this is a preprocessed dataset of ALFRED problem files that contains the PDDL paths referenced in `dataset/alfred-linearized-100-NLgoals-operators.json`. To prepare this from scratch, use the raw PDDL files hosted [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sg8v1hf40Eu1K7hLGZ_LP5I-9N4zwLCU/view?usp=sharing), and is originally copied from the MIT internal version at `/data/vision/torralba/datasets/ALFRED/data/full_2.1.0/`. We extract this to `dataset/alfred_pddl`; you should see three internal folders (train, valid_seen, valid_unseen). This provides the PDDL paths referenced in `dataset/alfred-NLgoal-operators.json`.
   - Prepare the ALFRED PDDL files. We modify the ALFRED domain to support simple fast downward planning. Run `prepare_alfred_pddl.py` to do so.
2. *Clone the GIT Submodules*. We maintain these separately rather than add them as submodules.
   - `pddlgym_planners`. This contains the fast-downward task planner that we use in llm_operators/task_planner.py - https://github.com/ronuchit/pddlgym_planners
   - `alfred`. This is a fork of the main ALFRED repository (https://github.com/jiahai-feng/alfred) that we have updated to support task and motion planning from PDDL with custom operators.

3. *Install the pretrained motion planner weights*. These are also located in the llm_operators_datasets. 
```
unzip llm_operators_datasets/t5-small-finetuned-alfred-long.zip
mv -R llm_operators_datasets/t5-small-finetuned-alfred-long llm_operators/alfred/t5-small-finetuned-alfred-long
``` 
- Developer notes: The Alfred motion planner uses a T5 module that been pretrained to support low-level planning towards the predicates in ALFRED. 

4. *Add an OpenAI environment key.* If you do not have one, you can add in any dummy key. This will just not be able to run the OPENAI portions from scratch. Edit `.bash_profile` to contain `export OPENAI_API_KEY=<OPEN_AI_KEY>` and run `source .bash_profile`.

5. *Create the ALFRED Python environment.* We assume you have conda. We use the following conda setup, tested on M1:
```
conda create --name llm-operators-38 python=3.8
pip install -r alfred_requirements.txt
```

You should also check if you can run `gtimeout` and run `brew install coreutils` otherwise on an M1 Mac.
You may also need to `brew install cmake` to build the task planner.

6. *Modify the AI2Thor installation.* This is the jankiest part - the AI2Thor installation required for ALFRED uses a deprecated numpy version. To edit this, you should locate the local installation of AI2Thor within the conda environment. Start your environment, and run:
```
python # This opens an interactive terminal.
> import ai2thor
> print(ai2thor.__file__)
# This should output a location like /Users/<USER>/opt/anaconda3/envs/llm-operators-38/lib/python3.8/site-packages/ai2thor/__init__.py
```
Now modify the `server.py` definition in AI2Thor, using whatever code editor you like. For instance, in vim:
```
vim /Users/<USER>/opt/anaconda3/envs/llm-operators-38/lib/python3.8/site-packages/ai2thor/server.py

# Now, in vim, change the line that says 
   return np.asscalar(obj)
# You should change this line to read:
   return obj.item()
```

6. *Run a demo command to test the task and motion planner.*  (Last modified: 4-4-2023). This is under development. However, you can run the following command to test that the ALFRED-specific portions of this are working.
```
python main.py --experiment_name alfred_linearized_100_supervision_pddl_pick_place_clean_38354 --dataset_name alfred_linearized_100 --supervision_name supervision --pddl_domain_name alfred_linearized --dataset_fraction 1.0 --training_plans_fraction 1.0 --initial_plans_prefix pick_and_place_simple pick_clean_then_place_in_recep --initial_pddl_operators GotoLocation PickupObjectInReceptacle PickupObjectNotInReceptacle PutObjectInReceptacle PutReceptacleObjectInReceptacle CleanObject --verbose --train_iterations 1 --dataset_pddl_directory data/dataset/alfred_linearized_pddl --output_directory generated --debug_mock_propose_plans --debug_ground_truth_operators --debug_ground_truth_goals --assume_alfred_teleportation
```
- You should see this install the FastDownward (FD) planner inside `pddlgym_planners`. If this fails, see the `pddlgym_planners` repository ([here](https://github.com/ronuchit/pddlgym_planners.git)).
- You should see this open a Unity window in which motion planning succeeds.
- ==> Re-running this will write over the `experiment_name` directory. If you run this command locally, consider adding a timestamp (eg. --experiment_name alfred_linearized_100_supervision_pddl_pick_place_clean_3_3`.
--------------------------------------------
##### Adding in new domains. 
The following describes how we add in the ALFRED domain, which comprises a ground truth PDDL domain file, a set of individual PDDL tasks and NL annotations, and a motion planner.
1. Registering a PDDL domain: to register a new PDDL domain (which you can then specify using the `--pddl_domain_name` flag for `main.py`), you should register a new PDDL domain file loader, like the ALFRED example [here](https://github.com/CatherineWong/llm-operators/blob/main/datasets.py#L201), which initializes a new [Domain](https://github.com/CatherineWong/llm-operators/blob/main/pddl.py#L14) object. Our example also optionally implements a `operator_canonicalization` and `codex_types` attribute that is only used to construct Codex prompts, and is probably not necessary for new, non-ALFRED domains. In general, this PDDL file should contain both a set of ground truth operators and all of the predicates you want to plan over in FD and prompt Codex with.
2. Registering a dataset of new tasks: register a new dataset loader (which you can then specify using the `--dataset_name` flag for `main.py`) , like the example [here](https://github.com/CatherineWong/llm-operators/blob/main/datasets.py#L447). This should load both a set of PDDL problem files (the ALFRED ones are downloaded separately, see below, ALFRED PDDL dataset) and NL annotations, and creates a {<SPLIT_NAME> : {task_id : [Problem](https://github.com/CatherineWong/llm-operators/blob/main/datasets.py#L14)}} structure for loading train/test splits of problems.
These two steps should be enough to get the basic task planning + Codex portion running. To then add a domain-specific motion planner,
3. Adding a motion planner: you'd add in another motion planner [here](https://github.com/CatherineWong/llm-operators/blob/main/motion_planner.py#L30).
