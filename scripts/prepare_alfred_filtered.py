"""
prepare_alfred_filtered.py
Allows a human annotator to reject examples of goals based on the oracle goal check.

Rejection criteria:
1. Final location is missing from goal. Example: "get a knife to cut a tomato." - train/pick_and_place_simple-TomatoSliced-None-SinkBasin-5/trial_T20190907_233445_502551
2. Object is missing from goal: Example: "get the knife from the counter then open and close the fridge door." - train/pick_and_place_simple-TomatoSliced-None-Fridge-6/trial_T20190907_233305_019895
3. Key verb is entirely missing from goal, and cannot be inferred from the receptacle. "move cooked food to the kitchen table." - train/pick_heat_then_place_in_recep-BreadSliced-None-DiningTable-7/trial_T20190906_200122_168916 -- this is also an example of entirely missing the core specified object.
    "putting a tomato slice in the fridge." - train/pick_heat_then_place_in_recep-TomatoSliced-None-Fridge-14/trial_T20190911_114912_806806

3. Overspecification of goal (this might make it impossible to execute): Example: "to put a cooled plus sliced tomato on the table to the right of the fridge." - train/pick_and_place_simple-TomatoSliced-None-SideTable-3/trial_T20190908_091658_623792
4. 

Acceptable:
1. Any reasonable synonym for a location: Example: "place a chilled pan in the cupboard." - train/pick_cool_then_place_in_recep-Pan-None-Cabinet-18/trial_T20190907_222321_075263
2. Any reasonable synonym for a verb: Example: "put a microwaved egg in the garbage." -- train/pick_heat_then_place_in_recep-Egg-None-GarbageCan-8/trial_T20190909_120617_866099
