The AI agent here is a household robot that can navigate to various large and normally immovable furniture pieces or appliances in the house to carry out household tasks. Note that the robot has only one gripper, so (a) it can only hold one object; (b) it shouldn't hold any other irrelevant objects in its gripper while performing some manipulation tasks (e.g., opening a drawer or closing a window); (c) operations on small household items should be carried out on furniture with a flat surface to get enough space for manipulation.
