The AI agent here is a household robot that can navigate to various large and normally immovable furniture pieces or appliances in the house to carry out household tasks. Note that the robot has only one gripper, so (a) it can only hold one object; (b) it shouldn't hold any other irrelevant objects in its gripper while performing some manipulation tasks (e.g., opening a drawer or closing a window); (c) operations on small household items should be carried out on furniture with a flat surface to get enough space for manipulation. There are three major types of objects in this domain: robot, furnitureAppliance, and householdObject. The object type furnitureAppliance covers large and normally immovable furniture pieces or appliances, such as stove burners, side tables, dining tables, drawer, cabinets, or microwaves. The object type householdObject covers all other small household items, such as handheld vacuum cleaners, cloth, apples, bananas, and small receptacles like bowls and lunch boxes. There is a subtype of householdObject called smallReceptacle that covers small receptacles like bowls, lunch boxes, plates etc. In this domain, the locations of the robot and small household items (e.g., apples, oranges, bowls, lunch boxes or lamps) are determined by large and normally immovable furniture pieces or appliances.

The domain incudes following actions:
1. go-to-a-furniture-piece-or-an-appliance: This action enables the robot to navigate from one normally immovable piece of furniture to another (e.g., dining tables, side tables, cabinets, and sinks) or an appliance (e.g., refrigerators, coffee makers, microwaves, and washers).

2. pick-up-an-object-on-or-in-a-furniture-piece-or-an-appliance: This action enables the robot to pick up an object object_1 in/on a large piece of furniture (e.g., dining tables, drawers, cabinets) or an appliance (e.g., dishwashers and refrigerators). For example, the robot pick up coffee_mug_1 on dining_table_1, the robot pick up fork_1 in drawer_1, or the robot pick up apple_1 in refrigerator_1.This action is only applicable for objects that are pickupable by the robot. The furniture piece or appliance should be opened if it is openable. The object to pick up should not be stacked on top of other household items.

3. put-an-object-on-or-in-a-furniture-piece-or-an-appliance: This action enables the robot to put an object object_1 in/on a large piece of furniture (e.g., dining tables, drawers, cabinets) or an appliance (e.g., dishwashers and refrigerators). For example, the robot puts coffee_mug_1 on dining_table_1, the robot puts fork_1 in drawer_1, or the robot puts apple_1 in refrigerator_1.The furniture piece or appliance should be opened if it is openable.

4. stack-objects: This action enables the robot to stack one object object_1 on top of another object object_2 that is on the same piece of furniture. For example, the robot stacks book_1 on top of book_2, or the robot stacks lunch_box_1 on top of lunch_box_2.The furniture piece has to have an open and flat surface. Note that object_1 and object_2 both must be stackable objects. You may assume the robot is holding object_1 at the beginning. Also, there should be no other object on top of object_2.

5. unstack-objects: This action enables the robot to unstack one object object_1 that is on top of another object object_2. For example, the robot stacks book_1 on top of book_2, or the robot stacks lunch_box_1 on top of lunch_box_2. The robot will hold the object after unstacking it.
